Reeftown is a short 2.5D game built in Unreal Engine 5.5, where players must escape a shark-infested town. I designed the game mechanics and level, to create an engaging experience with dynamic abilities and combat. Players can utilize two unique abilities to defeat sharks and to escape the town.

The game was too bulky for Github... BUT you can still get it in Github Releases!
